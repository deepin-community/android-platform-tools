This package includes a bunch of symlinks and other little tricks to
create the same path layout as is used by the official Android SDK
binaries released by Google.

Also, this utility is only ever known as 'dx' in the Android world as
well as the official documentation.  The other tools that rely on it
only ever call it as 'dx'.  There is already a package called 'dx' in
Debian that is totally unrelated.  For now, this package Conflicts:
with 'dx' so that it can provide /usr/bin/dx, as users will expect.
